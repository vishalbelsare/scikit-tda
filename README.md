Scikit-TDA is a home for Topological Data Analysis Python libraries intended for non-topologists.

This project aims to provide a curated library of TDA Python tools that are widely usable and easily approachable. It is structured so that each package can stand alone or be used as part of the `scikit-tda` bundle.
